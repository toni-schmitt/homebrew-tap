  # A formula rather than a cask: casks are macOS-only, and this covers
  # Homebrew on Linux too. It installs the prebuilt Native AOT binaries, so no
  # .NET SDK is needed on the target machine.
  #
  # There is no `version` stanza: Homebrew scans it from the URL, and declaring
  # it as well trips the "redundant with version scanned from URL" audit.
  #
  # macOS ships ONE universal (x86_64 + arm64) tarball, so both arch blocks
  # point at the same file. The duplication is deliberate: FormulaAudit's
  # ComponentsOrder cop rejects `url`/`sha256` as direct children of `on_macos`,
  # and only inspects direct children — so nesting one level down is what makes
  # `brew audit --strict` pass.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Point Claude Code at the binaries:

        ember --install

      That merges the statusLine block into ~/.claude/settings.json rather than
      overwriting it, using this formula's own resolved paths.

      The default icon set needs a Nerd Font in your terminal. Without one, add
      --icons=unicode (or --icons=ascii) to the command in settings.json.
